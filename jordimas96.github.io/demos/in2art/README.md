# IN2ART - UX/UI Demonstrations (2022)


### Description:
These videos are a demo of the user interface and experience of a social network I contributed to as a Frontend programmer at IN2ART during its development.
The website was publicly accessible in 2022, with promotional efforts encouraged by the company. These recordings were made after my departure, in order to document and present its visual and functional state at that time.

For more information on my work in IN2ART, visit the [IN2ART section in my portfolio](https://jordimas96.github.io/section/in2art).

- The structure, interface and component logic shown in these videos were designed and implemented by me, based on generic mockups and project requirements, while incorporating my own development style.

- These videos are shared under fair use, strictly for demonstration purposes and are not intended for commercial use.
- No private or confidential information is included.


### Purpose:
- Demonstrate my work in frontend development and UI design approach.
- Showcase visual effects, responsiveness and adaptive design across different devices.
